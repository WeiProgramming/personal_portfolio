								<h3>My past</h3>
								<p>I came from humble beginnings where I had two immigrant parents who worked hard to support and
								pushed me to succeed. I lost my mother when I was 9 from cancer, it placed a daunting financial strain on my father, whom struggled to work low paying jobs day and night to cover the medical expenses. He was constantly stressed out with no help from our family or friends as we didn't have many,  At one point my father and I were almost homeless after failing to pay for rent in our small one bedroom apartment.
								<br/>
								Since my father didn't speak english, I acted as our home's english translator in every scenario, to doctors, auto-shop, food, anything that required communication.
								At such a young age I didn't think my life was terrible, just hectic and lots of hospital visitiations. I assumed many kids at my age were expeeriencing the same, I didn't know better. 
								<br/>
								</p>
															<h3>Finding my Passion</h3>
								<p>I majored in computer science at San Diego State University, during my second year in college, I felt
								I was losing interest with programming, this was due to the assingments and lack of effort I felt my professors pushed upon us as students. I was really close with switching out my computer science major track with something else, something more business oriented, but I decided to try out different topics in computer science and veering away from college curriculum to see if I can have a profound new passion. I started over the following summer just reading about java, I didn't like it so I checked out android development for about 2 months, which I had a lot of fun doing however, I felt I wasn't that good at it at the time and school started with classes yet again veering me away from android further. I then moved to cyber security where I joined San Digo State's cyber defense club, there I was moved by the idea of cyber security, I wanted to really succeed in this field hearing about the opportunity and the potential I can learn. So I forked over $200+ (which is a lot for a college student) to be a member for a year. Needless to say, I lost the initial drive with this field, I tried everything I could to learn what I can for the money's worth, however, due to poor management and zero direction when the club actually began I was always lost in every meeting with nobody offering any help. 
								</p>
															<h3>Me right now</h3>
								<p>Feeling like there was nothing for me, no actual drive, I finally took up web development, though I didn't have any proper guidance at all, I soon realized I really love creating web applications and designing them. I feel web development revived and opened my eyes to the tech world. Web really helped me become a self starter and being fully self taught.
